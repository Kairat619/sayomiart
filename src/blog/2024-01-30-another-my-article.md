The job of the graphic designer may have changed a lot lately, but the good news is that the discipline is still in demand more than ever. As businesses battle to survive the coming recession, good design will help them stand out visually, connect with their audiences, and create the brand loyalty they so desperately need.

That means the best graphic designers should not want to work in 2024, although, at the same time, you may be expected to do more than ever. It's no longer good enough to only design for print or even digital. There's also motion, AR, VR, mixed reality, and more. The good news is that good design is always good, whatever the platform. So as you stick to the same design fundamentals that have carried you so far, you should be in a strong place.

In this article, we bring together experts from across graphic design who share their thoughts, fears, and hopes for 2024.

### Trend 1: A revolution in design tools

Arguably the biggest change in graphic design in 2023 won't be what our designs look like or how they function, but how we make them. "If late 2022 was defined by the emergence of AI in art and design, I think we're really on the edge of a design tool nirvana," believes Nick Hill of Re Design.

 "Plugins and tools have always been around but have stuck behind tricky workflows," he explains. "Tools like Figma helped democratize the 'plugin', and at Re, we now use the software for so much more than what it was originally intended for. Apps like Runway have made inpainting and masking content, which used to take hours of specialized work, available in minutes. There's been a recent resurgence in parametric type design that I'm excited about. And tools such as Cavalry are bringing procedural and node-based design, previously only possible in expensive 3D software, into 2D."
