Keep in mind that when you see "any seafood", this can also include Clams, Oysters, or Scallops you find on Dazzle Beach, so you don't necessarily have to use up any of your more valuable seafood in order to make this five-star offering.



The best thing about Lancetfish Paella is that it restores a massive amount of energy, ensuring you'll get a full bar of golden energy for all of the working--or hovering--that you need to do throughout your valley. It's probably not a reasonable option to make with frequency given how many ingredients it needs, but it doesn't hurt to keep some around for when you need big bursts of energy.



Of course, there are so many more recipes in Disney Dreamlight Valley, so when you're ready to do some more cooking, be sure you reference our handy recipe list. For everything else you need to know about this cozy Disney adventure, you can check out our comprehensive guides hub.
