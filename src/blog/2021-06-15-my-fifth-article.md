1. A Scarf: 

Scarves are one of the fashion trends that is sure to give you a stylish feel. 

If there’s anything that guarantees your being stylish, it is versatility, and scarves offer this. Being able to utilize a fashion item in many awesome ways is so satisfying, and of course stylish.

Not only is a scarf versatile, but it is also very unique – there are only a few people who wear scarves as a fashion item.\

2. A Minimalist Necklace:

Minimalist fashion pieces are a staple for everyone who aspires to look stylish.

Typically, they come in simple designs which makes it easy to pair them with any look, on any day and at any time while completing your look and making a fashion statement at the same time. \

3. A Sweater Vest:

Third, on the list of fashion trends that can help you look stylish in 2021 is a Sweater Vest.

Gone are the days when sweater vests were worn as part of a school uniform. This piece of clothing has found its way up the fashion ladder and keeps going high.

Want to look stylish in 2021? Pair your sweater vest with a classic white shirt or a puffy long-sleeved top.\

4. A Leather Jacket:

Besides being a unique alternative to denim jackets, leather jackets provide more room for exploration and they are great for adding a modish feel to your look, or as my fellow Nigerians will say, a ‘jasi’ look.

I particularly love the energy and vibe that leather jackets exude, and I find it incredible that you can style them across multiple looks. 

They can be paired with gowns, skirts, jeans, etc.\

5. A Turtleneck:

The last item on the list of fashion trends that can help you look stylish in 2021 is a Turtleneck.

Did I hear you say “turtleneck!”?

Hear me out.

There’s more to turtlenecks than simply pairing them with maxi skirts. While maxi skirts are not a bad idea, it is not the best either. If you want to look stylish in 2021, you should consider going beyond the basics.

Like scarves, turtlenecks afford versatility. You can pair turtlenecks with literally every piece of clothing; from straight leather skirts to palazzos, pants, plaid skirts, and a pair of jeans.

For a more stylish look, pair turtlenecks with plaid skirts, palazzos, and pants.
