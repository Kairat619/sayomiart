The best setup to win Fort Condor matches

For our Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Fort Condor matches, we chose the following setup:



* Option #4: Entrench - Stronghold Defense Focus
* Hero units: Cloud and Barret

There are several reasons for this. The first is that the Elite Enforcer/Enforcer plus 3x Cleric combo is nigh unbeatable due to tackiness and healing. We had most of our units focus on the right lane while watching out for hostiles that were encroaching along the left. Then, as we advanced farther afield, we summoned Elite Rangers, Ballistae, and Trebuchets to deal damage at a distance.

Since we primarily used defense units, followed by ranged units, we were often able to call on Cloud and Barret, too. We summoned them just as enemies group up close to our own troops due to the AoE damage that they deal.

Here's how our matches went:

* Start with 1x Elite Enforcer along the right side lane.
* Spawn 2x Clerics a few paces behind the Elite Enforcer, followed by 1x Elite Ranger. They should be able to heal and deal damage, respectively, without being hit by enemy attacks.
* Once you get past the chokepoint, spawn 1x Trebuchet slightly to the right of the chokepoint. This will deal AoE damage to clustered enemies.
* Adapt accordingly depending on how the matches go. For instance, if hostile units are advancing along the left lane, you can plop down Elite Vanguards to handle them. You may also place another Elite Enforcer, Enforcer, or Cleric along the right lane as backups.
* Trebuchets and Ballistae can sometimes block advancing enemy units, but pathing is also somewhat unreliable.
* Once you've summoned enough defense or ranged units, and if there are multiple foes clustered together, go ahead and summon Cloud or Barret. They will take out most opponents, and then aid your squad in attacking the enemy headquarters.
